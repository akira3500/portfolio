# Portfolio

## Setup

Developed with node 8.1.2

```
$ npm install
```

## Running in dev mode

```
$ npm run start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` from your browser.


## Build (production)

Build will be placed in the `build` folder.

```
$ npm run build
```

## Running in preview production mode

This command will start webpack dev server, but with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.
Everything will be minified and served.
Hot reload will not work, so you need to refresh the page manually after changing the code.

```
$ npm run preview
```
